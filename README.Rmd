The rROMA package is being developed as an alternative to the use of the java interface to [ROMA](https://github.com/sysbio-curie/Roma). It is currently under development and is only marginally functional.

## Intalling rROMA

The rRoma package can be installed using `devtools`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("Albluca/rROMA")
```
